# Security

If you suspect you may have found a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue or pull request. Instead, please [send us a private advisory](https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex-rails/security/advisories/new).

You should hear from us within a week, though we aim to release patches as quickly as possible. The last two security patches were released within a few hours of being reported privately to us.
